# AppleSeeds Weekend Assigment 5 - Dice Game

This is a 2 Players  *(blackjack like)* dice game..
Players pick a target score and each roll and hold untill one of them reaches the target score or passes it.

More specific rules and mechanics will be explained below.

## Game Rules

In your turn - roll the dice [at least once] and accumulate the result in "Current".

You can roll again or click "Hold" to save the points from "Current" and end the turn.

**Note!** If you get 6-6 - you will lose all points from "Current" and the turn will go to your opponent.

If you managed to reach exactly the target score - you win! If you passed it - you lose.
